Press ENTER to shoot the ball at one of the colored boxes. The higher the box is, the more points you can earn!

To quit the game press BACKSPACE and you'll be redirected to the main menu.

If you miss a box or take too much time in shooting, you lose a life and answer a conjugation question.

If you miss a box AND get a question wrong, you'll lose two lives.

The questions consist of regular and irregular verbs in the French language and will pop up after you score a certain amount of points in game.

Answering any of the pop up questions earns you five points. The game ends if you lose all your lives.

Bonne chance!
